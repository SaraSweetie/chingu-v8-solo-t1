# Tickybot Clone Project

This is my first time participating in Chingu. The first steps are to complete a solo project based on your current skills. I choose the Teir 1 project, which is cloning the landing page for [Tickybot](https://tickybott.herokuapp.com).

## Requirements

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow you to:
* Click the navigation bar and be scrolled to the corresponding page section.
* Click a button which scrolls you back to the top of the page.
* Implement every other section of the page.
* Create your own solution without looking at the page source for the site you are cloning.

Bonus:
* Implement responsive design

## Images

## Project Reflection

You can view [My Tickybot clone](https://sarasweetie.github.io/chingu-v8-solo-t1/). 

The project went well for me. I have a solid understanding of HTML and CSS. I used Flexbox for the layout and @keyframes for the button:hover animations. I added media queries for a responsive design. I implemented scroll-behavior: smooth; for smooth scrolling but with limited browser support am looking into using Javascript.

Project To-Do:
* smooth scrolling with Javascript
* animate in the first time the page loads
* animate the 3 boxes in How it Works when scrolling
* animate the back to top button, fade in when scrolling and add the bounce
