# Tickybot Clone Project

This is my first time participating in Chingu. The first steps are to complete a solo project based on your current skills. I choose the Teir 1 project, which is cloning the landing page for [Tickybot](https://tickybott.herokuapp.com).

## Requirements

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow you to:
* Click the navigation bar and be scrolled to the corresponding page section.
* Click a button which scrolls you back to the top of the page.
* Implement every other section of the page.
* Create your own solution without looking at the page source for the site you are cloning.

Bonus:
* Implement responsive design
